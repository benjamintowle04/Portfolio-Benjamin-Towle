        <h2 class="project-header">Schedulity: Mobile Student Scheduling Application</h2>

        <p class="project-description">Schedulity represents a dedicated mobile scheduling application tailored
            specifically for college students, offering comprehensive organization of daily, weekly, and monthly
            schedules. Crafted collaboratively by a team of four adept students, including myself, I assumed the
            frontend developer role for the Android Studio application, primarily focusing on seamlessly integrating
            user input into our backend system.
            The application's core functionality generates a personalized working schedule based on user-provided
            details such as class schedules, extracurricular activities, and gym sessions. Developed as part of an
            introductory software development class, the project aimed to simulate a professional atmosphere, instilling
            essential skills required for efficient software design.</p>

        <p class="project-description">Throughout the semester-long endeavor, I honed various technical and professional
            competencies, notably adept use of version control systems, specifically Git, mastery of object-oriented
            programming principles, and effective collaboration within a team dynamic. The project served as a practical
            lesson in time management and meeting deadlines, essential attributes for any engineer operating in a
            professional setting
            As one of the two frontend developers, a significant aspect of my contribution involved implementing an
            immediate user survey upon account registration. This survey efficiently captured and transmitted
            user-inputted data to the backend team and database. This process marked my introduction to the critical
            concept of communication between client-side and server-side programs, representing one of the most pivotal
            technical insights gained from this project.</p>

        <h2 class="project-header">IRobot Mars Rover Mission</h2>

        <p class="project-description">One of the most gratifying projects I undertook during college was the IRobot
            Mars Rover Mission. Collaborating with a team of three engineering students, we conceptualized, developed,
            and tested an embedded C application programmed on a Texas Instruments Tiva TM4C123 Microcontroller. The
            primary objective of our application was to enable users to manually navigate an IRobot Roomba across a
            designated test field directly from their PC, facilitated by a wireless UART connection.</p>

        <p class="project-description">
            Our project timeline was centered around the culmination of our efforts, the final demo day. On this day, we
            aimed to showcase the functionality of our embedded C program, requiring one of our group members to
            skillfully navigate the Roomba without visual access to the test field. To achieve this, our group
            ingeniously crafted a Python application capable of processing infrared and sonar scan data from the robot,
            translating it into a comprehensive 3D model representing obstacles within the robot's field of vision.</p>

        <p class="project-description">Our group successfully implemented these features through meticulous design and
            collaborative effort, culminating in an embedded program that adeptly steered the IRobot to its destination
            without encountering any obstacles. This project demonstrated our proficiency in embedded systems and
            programming and highlighted our ability to innovate and problem-solve in complex engineering endeavors. </p>

        <h2 class="project-header">MIPS Processor Designs</h2>

        <p class="project-description">In this project, our team designed and developed three integrated processors
            capable of supporting an extensive repertoire of over 30 MIPS assembly instructions. The collaborative
            effort involved a group of three, including myself, each responsible for designing specific components
            integral to our high-level architectural design. These components encompassed the Arithmetic Logical Unit
            (ALU), the Register File, the Data and Instruction Memory Units, and other essential elements. Our
            overarching objective was to enhance the performance and execution times of our processor through iterative
            design improvements.</p>

        <p class="project-description">
            The progression of our designs encompassed three distinct processor models: the single-cycle processor, the
            hardware-scheduled pipeline, and the software-scheduled pipeline. Each design iteration aimed to optimize
            the overall efficiency of our processor.</p>

        <p class="project-description">Our processor's operational sequence is initiated by fetching instructions from
            the instruction memory. Subsequently, the decoding process transformed these instructions into a binary
            address, dictating the ALU operation to be executed, identifying registers for reading and writing, and
            determining the address to which the Program Counter (PC) would jump.</p>

        <p class="project-description">This project provided invaluable experience working with hardware design
            languages, particularly VHDL, and deepened my understanding of the intricate communication dynamics between
            hardware and software. The successful completion of each design iteration demanded a considerable investment
            of time, often requiring more than 20 hours per week. Throughout this intensive process, our group applied
            effective communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills, which collectively contributed to
            the successful realization of this intricate project.</p>

        <h2 class="project-header">Python Arcade Game</h2>

        <p class="project-description">In my pursuit of learning Python and exploring its external libraries, I embarked
            on the design of a simple yet engaging arcade-style game. Leveraging the Turtle library in Python, I
            constructed a straightforward 2D graphical user interface where users control a small white circle.</p>

        <p class="project-description">The objective of the game is for users to maximize their score by strategically
            maneuvering the white circle to consume food items represented by green circles while avoiding enemy objects
            in the form of triangles of varying colors. The challenge lies in maintaining the circle within bounds while
            navigating the growing complexity of the game.</p>

        <p class="project-description">As users successfully consume food items, their white circle expands, and their
            score increments by 10. The game dynamically adjusts in difficulty, presenting a continuous challenge as
            users strive to achieve higher scores.</p>

        <p class="project-description">This project served as a platform for applying my problem-solving abilities and
            applying object-oriented programming principles. Through the implementation of this simple yet engaging
            game, I honed my skills and gained practical experience in Python and its libraries, fostering a deeper
            understanding of the language's capabilities</p>
